Flurry of Blows
The chances of performing an offhand strike while unnarmed or wielding natural weapons is increased by 5% multiplied against your agility modifier. This is further increased by 5% per character level.

Combination Strikes I
Dealing consecutive strikes while unnarmed or wielding a natural weapon increases your damage in increments of 5% up to 50% per successful hit, this refreshes after leaving combat or missing/failing to penetrate with your attack.

Your body is conditioned to take blows and your combat experience allows you to react more strategically to taking hits, you are more resistant to being stunned and dazed, and harder to knock prone. You gain +10 to your Quickness.

Grappler
Grapple enemies, a grappled enemy loses their DV bonus and must succeed an agility or strength saving throw vs the grappler's strength modifier to escape.

Path of The Salt-Back [Stand Your Ground]
Sacrifice attack power for defensive capabilities. Sacrificing consecutive attacks and your damage bonus, you can now deflect enemies blows with a 20% chance of adding your toughness to your AC on a sucessful block. Successful blocks count towards your Combination Strikes. [Wearing bracers or wristblades increases this chance 10%.]

Path of the Salthopper [Break Your Enemy Down]
Sudden, high precision strikes that target sensitive areas on the foe; melee damage switches to agility, cannot deliver combinations strikes, however each blow has a 10% chance of adding either Immobilize, Confuse, Stun, Daze or Crippled/Hobbled to your enemy.

Path of The Slumberling [Opportunity for Vicious Reprieval]
Vicious sweeping attacks that harm all while throwing away all defensive abilities. At the cost of half your AV and DV, attacks while unnarmed now deal damage to nearby foes, for every successful hit on an opponent, enemies flanking you must make a penetration save or be dealt 50% of the damage. There's a 2% chance each strike, you might dismember an opponents limb. On a successful dismemberment, enemies flanking you must make a Willpower saving throw or be given the Fear effect.

Path of the Astral Cabby [Disengage, Return to Neutral]
Evasive, untouchable, no matter how many flank you--you move as the void does. When flanked by multiple enemies, you add your agility modifier to your DV per unit surrounding you, successful dodges build your Combination Strike counter and you gain a +5 to movement speed, you however lose your unnarmed damage bonus and can longer perform consecutive attacks.



Master of Stances:
Switching stances no longer cost energy. 

Combination Strikes III
